        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz beef sirloin steak</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp coconut oil</li>
            <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tsp miso paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 packs (3 oz each) of ramen noodles</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a lid. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the steak is resting, combine broth, miso paste, garlic, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Once broth is at a slow boil, add ramen noodles. Cook until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Transfer broth and noodles to 2 bowls. Slice steak and place on top.</li>
        </ol>
