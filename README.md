Project Recipes

This website project will consist of a main index page having links to a couple of 
favorite recipes. The project's main purpose is to practice building a simple html 
website with its boilerplate structure. It will also incldue images, anchor tags with 
links, title, paragraphs, headers, bold/italicized words, and ordered/unordered lists. 

Reflection: This is a refresher for me since more than 5 years ago since I've taken 
a HTML/CSS class. I don't remember much but the concepts of elements, tags, and 
attributes are coming back to me.
