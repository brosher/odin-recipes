Project Recipes

This website project will consist of a main index page having links to a couple of 
favorite recipes. The project's main purpose is to practice building a simple html 
website with its boilerplate structure. It will also incldue images, anchor tags with 
links, title, paragraphs, headers, bold/italicized words, and ordered/unordered lists. 

Reflection: This is a refresher for me since more than 5 years ago since I've taken 
a HTML/CSS class. I don't remember much but the concepts of elements, tags, and 
attributes are coming back to me.

Added links to recipe pages in the index page, created three new recipe webpages and linked 
to index.
